**NALT Protocol** is an open JSON specification for structuring and preserving essential personal information—such as personality, values, thoughts, and behavioral patterns—from all data generated by individuals in an AI-interpretable format.

This specification aims to accurately capture, reproduce, and extend "what makes someone who they are" in future advanced AI environments.

## Key Features

* **Context-Rich**: Connects events and thoughts not as isolated "points" but as "lines" with causal relationships and associations, preserving context.
* **Extensible**: Provides mechanisms to safely extend the specification while maintaining backward compatibility for future needs.
* **Reproducible**: Offers deterministic rules and controlled vocabularies to ensure data is interpreted consistently across different environments.
* **Privacy-First**: Recommends structures that separate personally identifiable information from content itself, respecting data owner control.

## Quick Start

Here's a minimal example of the NALT Protocol structure:

```json
{
  "spec_version": "nalt-protocol/1.1.0",
  "document_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "date": "2025-07-09",
  "meta": {
    "language": "en",
    "timezone": "America/New_York"
  },
  "entries": [
    {
      "entry_id": "20250709T180000Z-ref",
      "type": "reflection",
      "mode": "evening",
      "content_format": "text/plain",
      "content": "It was a fulfilling day."
    }
  ]
}
```
