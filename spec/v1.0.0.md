## 1. Overview and Design Philosophy

**NALT Protocol** is an open JSON specification for structuring and preserving essential personal information—such as personality, values, thoughts, and behavioral patterns—from all data generated by individuals in an AI-interpretable format.

This specification aims to accurately capture, reproduce, and extend "what makes someone who they are" in future advanced AI environments. Its design is based on four core principles:

* **Reproducibility**: Provides deterministic rules and controlled vocabularies to ensure data is interpreted consistently across different environments.
* **Contextuality**: Views events and thoughts not as isolated "points" but as graphs connected by "lines" with causal relationships and associations, preserving context.
* **Extensibility**: Provides mechanisms to safely extend the specification while maintaining backward compatibility for future needs.
* **Privacy**: Recommends structures that separate personally identifiable information from content itself, respecting data owner control.

## 2. Basic Structure and Top-Level Object

* Files MUST use **UTF-8** encoding.
* File extension is `.json`.
* Root element is a single JSON object.

| Field Name | Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `spec_version` | string | ✔︎ | Specification name and semantic version combined. Example: `"personal-data-protocol/1.0.0"` |
| `document_id` | string | Recommended | A globally unique ID such as UUIDv4 for this JSON document. |
| `date` | string | ✔︎ | The date entries belong to (`YYYY-MM-DD` format). |
| `meta` | object | ✔︎ | Stores processing context and metadata for the entire document. |
| `entries` | array | ✔︎ | An array containing one or more Entry objects. |

## 3. `meta` Object

Defines the context for the entire document.

| Field Name | Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `language` | string | ✔︎ | Default language for the document. Specified as ISO 639-1 code. Example: `"en"` |
| `timezone` | string | ✔︎ | Specified as IANA timezone database name. Example: `"America/New_York"` |
| `x_*` | any | Optional | Free extension data with `x_` prefix such as AI logs. |

## 4. `entries` and Entry Object

Represents each fragment (events, tasks, thoughts, etc.) of the diary.

**4.1 Core Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `entry_id` | string | ✔︎ | Unique ID for each Entry (UUIDv4 recommended). Serves as a key when referenced by other Entries. |
| `type` | string | ✔︎ | The type of content this Entry represents. Allowed values defined in [Section 5.1](#51-type-allowed-values). |
| `mode` | string | ✔︎ | Time of day when the Entry occurred. Allowed values defined in [Section 5.2](#52-mode-allowed-values-and-time-periods). |
| `content_format` | string | ✔︎ | Format of the `content` field. Examples: `"plain_text"`, `"markdown"` |
| `content` | string | ✔︎ | Original text data entered by the user. |

**4.2 Recommended Fields**

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `summary` | string | AI-generated concise summary of `content` (140 characters or less recommended). |
| `moods` | array | Array of one or more `{ "type": string, "intensity": number }` objects. `intensity` ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. |
| `tags` | array | Array of 1 to 6 `snake_case` string tags. |
| `entities` | object | Proper nouns extracted from text. Has keys like `people`, `locations`, `organizations`. **Recommend omitting this field entirely when there are no applicable entities.** |

**4.3 Optional Fields (`x_` prefix)**

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `x_relations` | array | Array of `{ "type": string, "target_id": string }` showing relationships to other Entries. Allowed values for `type` defined in [Section 5.3](#53-x_relationstype-allowed-values). |
| `x_due_date` | string | Due date for `task` type Entries (`YYYY-MM-DD` format). |
| `x_*` | any | Other freely definable extension data. |

## 5. Primary Field Definitions

**5.1 `type` Allowed Values**

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `event` | Concrete occurrences or actions that happened in the real world or were experienced by the user. |
| `reflection` | Introspection, contemplation, impressions, self-analysis, and other subjective thoughts or emotions of the user. |
| `task` | Concrete tasks to be executed such as to-do lists or reminders. |
| `idea` | Ideas, inspirations, creative concepts. |
| `log` | Monotonous records of specific data such as meals, sleep, reading. |

**5.2 `mode` Allowed Values and Time Periods**

| Value | Local Time Range |
| :--- | :--- |
| `morning` | 05:00 – 11:59 |
| `afternoon` | 12:00 – 17:59 |
| `evening` | 18:00 – 21:59 |
| `night` | 22:00 – 04:59 |
| `none` | When time period cannot be determined or for all-day events. |

**5.3 `x_relations.type` Allowed Values**

| Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `caused_by` | Indicates this Entry was caused by the Entry with `target_id` (cause). |
| `led_to` | Indicates this Entry led to the Entry with `target_id` (result). |
| `related_to` | Indicates theme or content is related to the Entry with `target_id` (relation). |
| `explains` | Indicates this Entry elaborates or supplements the Entry with `target_id`. |
| `contradicts` | Indicates this Entry contradicts the Entry with `target_id`. |

## 6. Segmentation Rules

To maintain consistency in implementation, the following entry segmentation rules are strongly recommended:

1.  **Time Period Change**: Segment when `mode` changes.
2.  **Clear Topic Change**: Segment when the topic changes significantly.
3.  **`type` Change**: Segment when the role of the entry changes, such as switching from `event` to `reflection`.
4.  **Character Count**: Consider segmentation when an entry's `content` exceeds approximately 400 characters in Japanese or 240 tokens in English.

## 7. Extension Policy

1.  Parsers MUST ignore unknown fields.
2.  When adding non-standard fields, they MUST be prefixed with `x_`.
3.  The official JSON Schema maintains `additionalProperties: true` to allow flexible extensions.

## 8. Validation

* **Official Schema**: `https://personal-data-protocol.org/schemas/v1.0.0/schema.json`
* **Validation Command Example**: `jsonschema -i [your-file.json] https://personal-data-protocol.org/schemas/v1.0.0/schema.json`
