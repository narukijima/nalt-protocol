# Migration Guide: v1.1.0 to v1.1.1

This guide helps you migrate NALT Protocol documents from v1.1.0 to v1.1.1.

## Overview of Changes

v1.1.1 introduces several important changes focused on clarifying temporal semantics:

1. **Removed top-level `timestamp` field** - Use entry-level `created_at` when needed
2. **Clarified `mode` definition** - Now explicitly represents event occurrence time
3. **Added optional `created_at` field** - For tracking when entries were recorded

## Breaking Changes

### 1. Top-Level Timestamp Removal
**v1.1.0**: Top-level `timestamp` field existed  
**v1.1.1**: Top-level `timestamp` field has been removed

**Migration Action**:
```javascript
// Remove top-level timestamp
const { timestamp, ...documentWithoutTimestamp } = document;

// If you need to preserve the recording time, add it to each entry
if (timestamp && document.entries) {
  document.entries.forEach(entry => {
    if (!entry.created_at) {
      entry.created_at = timestamp;
    }
  });
}

// Update spec_version
documentWithoutTimestamp.spec_version = 'nalt-protocol/1.1.1';
```

## Non-Breaking Changes

### 2. Mode Clarification
The `mode` field now explicitly represents when the event occurred, not when it was recorded. This is a clarification rather than a functional change, but it's important to understand:

- `mode`: Time when the event/thought/activity occurred
- `created_at`: Time when the entry was recorded (optional)

**Example**:
```json
{
  "entry_id": "abc123",
  "type": "reflection",
  "mode": "morning",  // The reflection is about morning events
  "content": "Thinking back on this morning's meeting...",
  "created_at": "2025-07-21T20:00:00Z"  // Recorded in the evening
}
```

### 3. New Optional `created_at` Field
Each entry can now have an optional `created_at` field to track when it was recorded.

```json
{
  "entry_id": "def456",
  "type": "event",
  "mode": "afternoon",
  "content_format": "text/plain",
  "content": "Had lunch with colleagues",
  "created_at": "2025-07-21T14:30:00Z"  // Optional timestamp
}
```

## Complete Migration Script

```javascript
function migrateToV111(v110Document) {
  // Destructure to remove timestamp
  const { timestamp, ...migratedDoc } = v110Document;
  
  // Update spec version
  migratedDoc.spec_version = 'nalt-protocol/1.1.1';
  
  // Optionally preserve timestamp in entries
  if (timestamp && migratedDoc.entries) {
    migratedDoc.entries = migratedDoc.entries.map(entry => {
      // Only add created_at if it doesn't exist
      if (!entry.created_at) {
        return { ...entry, created_at: timestamp };
      }
      return entry;
    });
  }
  
  return migratedDoc;
}

// Example usage
const v110Doc = {
  "spec_version": "nalt-protocol/1.1.0",
  "document_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "date": "2025-07-21",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-21T15:30:00Z",
  "meta": { /* ... */ },
  "entries": [ /* ... */ ]
};

const v111Doc = migrateToV111(v110Doc);
```

## Validation

After migration, validate your documents against the v1.1.1 schema:

```bash
# Using Python validator
python validator.py your-document.json --version v1.1.1

# Using Node.js validator
node validator.js your-document.json v1.1.1
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What happens to my existing timestamp data?**  
A: The top-level timestamp is removed, but you can preserve it by adding it as `created_at` to each entry during migration.

**Q: Is `created_at` required?**  
A: No, `created_at` is optional. Only use it when you need to track when entries were recorded.

**Q: Do I need to update all my `mode` values?**  
A: No changes to `mode` values are needed. The clarification is about interpretation: `mode` represents when the event occurred, not when it was recorded.

**Q: Can I still process v1.1.0 documents?**  
A: Yes, but you should migrate them to v1.1.1 for consistency. The migration is straightforward and mostly involves removing the timestamp field.
